      <h1>We are MIST</h1>
      <p>We are a team of Information and Network Security enthusiasts who have gathered knowledge about the field through workshops, online courses, books and research. We now want to spread the knowledge we have gained to other students with an interest in this ever-growing area of computer science. We want to ensure that students approach this field the right way and to provide them with a platform to enhance and practice their skills in the same. Last but not the least, we are not hackers. So if you are here with the intention of hacking into your ex's facebook account, I am afraid this is not the place for you.</p>
